                The task was to effectively synthesize the wealth of consumer feedback data in a form that would allow more employees to access and action off of these consumer insights. In order to design an effective live online feedback data dashboard as the solution, we had to understand current processes and shortcomings to identify opportunities.

            <p class="page-caption">Discovery phase entailed meeting with employees in various departments who would ultimately be the end-users of the dashboard. By probing their team needs and current practices, we identified the ways in which their needs weren't being met and opportunities for improvement. The left-hand side are direct quotes from some of the discovery interviews and the right-hand side are proposed solutions of the platform that would later be incorporated to the first iteration build of the dashboard.

            The three key areas of focus here were safety (how our product wasn't performing up to standard), returns (why our customers were frustrated with the product), and trends (what our customers were saying or feeling about our products).</p>
