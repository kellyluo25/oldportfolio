            <p class="desc-info">After spending so much time learning the ins and outs of the target customer, it was important to formalize these consumer insights into tangible concepts for the company. In the past, the product and marketing team lacked the resources to develop thorough personas as it rapidly scaled, so I took it upon myself to draw upon my previous UX experience and conceptualize consumer personas for the brand.
